# Hints — Matmul Kernels 1-3

## Kernel 1 (Naive)
Just C[row][col] = dot(A[row,:], B[:,col]). One thread, one element.

## Kernel 2 (Coalesced)
The ONLY change: `col` uses `threadIdx.x`, `row` uses `threadIdx.y`.

## Kernel 3 (Shared memory)
You've done this 5 times. If you're stuck, you have a problem.
Go re-read your own `~/projects/pmpp/chapter05/tiling_matmul.cu`.
